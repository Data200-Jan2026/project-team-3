# AI Job Replacement & Skill Shift Dataset

## Problem Statement

AI technologies are rapidly transforming industries by automating repetitive and routine tasks. Many traditional jobs are at risk of being replaced, while new job roles are emerging that require advanced digital and technical skills. Organizations face challenges in identifying which jobs are vulnerable, understanding skill gaps, and preparing employees for future demands. There is a need for a structured dataset that can analyze job replacement risk and skill shifts caused by AI adoption.

+ The objective of this project is to analyze the AI Job Replacement & Skill Shift Dataset to identify high-risk job sectors, understand changing skill requirements, and provide insights for workforce adaptation. The system focuses on data analysis, visualization, and prediction of automation risk rather than advanced AI development.

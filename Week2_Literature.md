# Week 2: Literature Review and Dataset Selection

## Literature Review

1. **AI and Job Automation**  
   Frey & Osborne (2017) estimated that nearly half of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation, especially routine tasks. Their study highlights the vulnerability of predictable work and the resilience of creative and social roles.  
   *Relevance*: Provides a baseline framework for identifying which job categories are most susceptible to AI replacement.

2. **Skill Transformation in the Age of AI**  
   OECD (2021) reported that AI adoption reshapes skill demand, emphasizing reskilling and lifelong learning. While some jobs are displaced, new roles emerge requiring digital literacy and adaptability.  
   *Relevance*: Supports the project’s focus on skill shifts, showing the importance of analyzing both displacement and creation of roles.

3. **Perceptions of AI and Job Displacement**  
   A 2023 survey study in Bangladesh revealed concerns about AI-driven job loss but also optimism about reskilling opportunities. Respondents stressed the need for education systems to adapt.  
   *Relevance*: Adds a human perspective, complementing quantitative datasets with attitudinal insights.

### Dataset Selection

- **Primary Dataset**: *AI Job Replacement & Skill Shift (2020–2026)* – Kaggle  
  Contains projections of automation adoption, job replacement rates, and skill demand changes across industries.  
  *Justification*: Directly aligned with the project topic, suitable for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.

- **Secondary Dataset**: *AI & Job Displacement Survey Dataset (Bangladesh)*  
  Captures perceptions and preparedness for AI-driven changes.  
  *Justification*: Provides qualitative insights to compare with quantitative trends, enriching the analysis.

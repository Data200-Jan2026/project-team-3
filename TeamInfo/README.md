# Project Title
-  Student Attendance Management System

## Problem Statement

+ Managing student attendance manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially in colleges with large numbers of students. Traditional paper-based attendance systems can lead to data loss, proxy attendance, difficulty in tracking attendance records, and delays in generating reports. There is a need for a simple, digital system that can record, store, and manage attendance efficiently while providing accurate summaries for teachers and administrators.

+ The objective of this project is to design and develop a Student Attendance Management System that allows teachers to mark attendance digitally and enables administrators to maintain centralized attendance records. The system focuses on ease of use, accuracy, and basic reporting rather than advanced technologies.

+ Planned features include:
+ - Student registration and management
+ - Course and class management
+ - Daily attendance recording
+ - Attendance summary and report generation
+ - Search and filtering of attendance records
+ - Basic authentication for teachers/admins

+ The system will be simple, user-friendly, and suitable for college-level implementation. It aims to reduce paperwork, save time, and improve the reliability of attendance data.
